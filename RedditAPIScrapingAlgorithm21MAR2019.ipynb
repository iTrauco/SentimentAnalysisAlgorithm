    "#### 1) Positive-negative scores calculated by the following equation(due to compound nature of every comment and the need for a neutral control mechanism): \n",
    "    1a. Positive: (neu / 2) + pos - (newsNeut / 2)\n",
    "    1b. Negative: (neu / 2) + neg - (newsNeut / 2)\n",
    "#### 2) Eliminating \"Obama\" from the comments did surprisingly little to reduce the large amount of raw neutral results. in future experiments, we will look to adopt a sentiment analysis algorithm with scoring and potentially nltk stopword support to mitigate this.\n",
    "#### 3) Sentiment analysis algorithms not behind a paywall are very niche in their application of those we found. These include, but are not limited to: Vader sentiment, Algorithmia, Textblob, github user created algorithms, sentiment analysis algorithms suggested on stack overflow, and nltk sentiment analysis. We ultimately chose Vader sentiment due to a combination of ease of use and the fact that it is trained explicitly on social media data, making it ideal for reddit comment analysis out of the explored options.\n",
